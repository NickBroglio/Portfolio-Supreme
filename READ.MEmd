# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This is my portfolio I will be updating as the classes go out for the next few months. I started off with a general portfolio template which I used as a mock-up. I used these few days to learn and practice my css, especially flexbox. I don't have any work yet to be put in this portfolio, everything is just a placeholder for now.
